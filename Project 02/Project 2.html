                <p>Between 1961 and 1965 F1 engine suppliers managed to increase engine power for the 1.5l formula by around 25 per cent, finishing the cycle with engines capable of producing around 220hp. Further development halted when a new set of regulations was introduced for 1966, with F1 returning to three-litre engines. </p>

                <p>The great success of the era arrived in 1967 when Cosworth launched the DFV (double four valve). The company had been lurking around the fringes of F1 for a while but the 3.0l, 90° V8 DFV is the engine which truly made its mark. The DFV powered 12 Drivers’ champions and 10 Constructors’ championships, winning 155 grands prix.</p>

                <h1>1975</h1>
                <p>The regulations introduced for 1966 allowed for a normally-aspirated engine of up to 3.0L displacement or a forced induction engine of up to 1.5l. The second part of the regulation was roundly ignored until 1977 when Renault debuted the RS01, powered by a 1.5l Renault-Gordini EF1 V6 turbo.</p>

                <p>Following the pattern established in the 1950s and 1960s, the move to a new set of regulations inspired a great diversity of engine design. The 3.5l normally-aspirated category was introduced in 1987 but properly began in 1989. Every engine manufacturer opted for a V-configuration but the variety within that was great. V8s, V10s and V12s all won races in 1989, with the 600hp Honda 72° V10 RA109E being the pick of the bunch, powering McLaren’s MP4/5 and Alain Prost to the titles. V10 was a new configuration for F1, a compromise between the higher power output of a V12 and the lower fuel consumption of a V8. </p>

                <h1>1991</h1>
                <p>Innovation continued at pace as engine makers set horsepower targets to match those of the turbo era – at least those for race engines. F1’s interest in metallurgy, developed intensely in the turbo era, continued, with Honda introducing titanium-alloy valves. Renault, meanwhile introduced their pneumatic valve system (offering finer control and lower weight at the top of the engine than the traditional return springs). Honda’s V10 hit 650hp at 13,800rpm in 1990 (now also using pneumatic valve control) but the company believed bigger gains could be made elsewhere. It introduced a 60° V12 for 1991. This provided a big leap in power output, reaching over 750hp, and became the only V12 to ever win a Constructors’ Championship. </p>

                <p>For 2006 the 3.0l V10 was replaced with a 2.4l V8. Exotic materials were banned in an effort to contain costs. Power output dropped back to 700-750hp for 2006 but Cosworth’s CA-series became F1’s first mainstream 20,000rpm race engine. </p>

                <p>Keen to push hybrid technology further, game-changing specifications were introduced in 2014. The most comprehensive overhaul in the history of F1came with a complex specification but a straightforward aim: the new spec would consume one-third less fuel than the V8 with no corresponding drop in performance.</p>
