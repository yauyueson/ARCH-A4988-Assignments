                    The CryptoPunks are 10,000 uniquely generated characters. No two are exactly alike, and each one of them can be officially owned by a single person on the Ethereum blockchain. Originally, they could be claimed for free by anybody with an Ethereum wallet, but all 10,000 were quickly claimed. Now they must be purchased from someone via the marketplace that's also embedded in the blockchain. Via this market you can buy, bid on, and offer punks for sale. Below, you'll find information about the status of each Punk in the market. Punks with a blue background are not for sale and have no current bids. Punks with a red background are available for sale by their owner. Finally, punks with a purple background have an active bid on them.

                <div>The MAYC is a strategy for rewarding Bored Ape holders with an entirely new NFT, a "freak" variety of their primates while allowing novices to participate in the BAYC biological system at a reduced degree of engagement. Freaks are the final stage of participation, and they mark the end of BAYC's Roadmap 1.0. moving forward, BAYC's centre would bring usefulness and "part's merely benefits," primarily to Bored Apes, and then Mutants.
